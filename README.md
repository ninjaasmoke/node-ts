# tsnode

tsnode - Create your NodeJS server with typescript!

tsnode is a CLI tool that helps build Node.Js applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.

It does **not** require *any* additional changes to your code during developement. It is a replacement wrapper for `node`. To use `tsnode`, replace the word `node` on the command line when executing your script.


# Installation

```bash
npm install -g tsnode
```

And tsnode will be installed globally to your system path.

### TODO 

- Kill the sub-process as well to exit
